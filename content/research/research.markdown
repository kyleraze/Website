## Working Papers

#### "Voting Rights and the Resilience of Black Turnout" [[PDF](/files/shelby_county_voting.pdf)] [[Appendix](/files/shelby_county_voting_appendix.pdf)]

The Voting Rights Act increased turnout among Black voters, which then, in turn, generated economic benefits for Black communities. In *Shelby County v. Holder* (2013), the Supreme Court invalidated the enforcement mechanism responsible for these improvements, prompting concerns that states with histories of discriminatory election practices would respond by suppressing Black turnout. I estimate the effect of the Shelby decision on the racial composition of the electorate using triple-difference comparisons of validated turnout data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study. The data suggest that the Shelby decision did not widen the Black-White turnout gap in states subject to the ruling.
